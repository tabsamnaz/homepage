            <p>Long after the sun sets, Bilbo swims to the shore and lets the dwarves out of their barrels; they are extremely tired
            and hungry. Because he is so wet and exhausted, the narrator notes, it would be some time before Thorin was polite to
            Bilbo again; nevertheless, he thanks Bilbo for saving them from the elves. The group makes its way into Lake-town, and
            Thorin announces himself as the King Under the Mountain and demands to be taken to the Master of the town.
